High-Level Description: Color Management System
Objective
Design a modular color management system to handle color operations such as representation, conversion, manipulation, and visualization. The system should support multiple color formats (e.g., RGB, HEX, HSL) and provide utilities for blending, complementing, and analyzing colors.

1. Libraries and Dependencies
•	Core Libraries
o	colorsys (for color space conversions like RGB to HSL/HSV)
o	re (for validating HEX and other string-based color formats)
o	math (for calculations like distance between colors)
•	Optional Libraries
o	matplotlib (for visualizing colors and palettes)
o	Pillow (for working with images and extracting colors)
o	numpy (for performance-optimized color operations, e.g., blending large datasets)

2. Architecture of the System
The system is divided into the following components:
a. Input Layer
Handles color input in various formats and ensures proper validation and parsing.
•	Accepts HEX, RGB, HSL, or named colors (e.g., "red").
•	Validates input using predefined rules and regex patterns.
•	Parses colors into a unified internal representation (e.g., RGB tuple).
b. Core Processing Layer
Performs color operations such as conversion, blending, and analysis.
•	Converts between different color formats.
•	Calculates complementary, analogous, and triadic colors.
•	Supports operations like blending and brightness adjustments.
c. Output Layer
Handles color visualization and output in different formats.
•	Displays colors visually using libraries like matplotlib.
•	Exports color palettes in formats like JSON, CSV, or image files.

3. High-Level Description of Modules or Components
Module 1: Color Representation
•	Provides data structures for storing colors in different formats (RGB, HEX, HSL).
Module 2: Color Conversion
•	Converts colors between formats:
o	RGB to HEX
o	HEX to RGB
o	RGB to HSL/HSV
o	HSL to RGB
Module 3: Color Manipulation
•	Supports operations such as:
o	Adjusting brightness or saturation.
o	Calculating complementary colors.
o	Generating color schemes (analogous, triadic, etc.).
Module 4: Color Blending
•	Combines two or more colors to create blended results.
•	Example blending modes:
o	Additive blending
o	Subtractive blending
o	Weighted blending
Module 5: Color Analysis
•	Calculates properties of colors, such as:
o	Distance between colors (for determining similarity).
o	Dominant colors in a palette.
•	Extracts color palettes from images (using Pillow).
Module 6: Color Visualization
•	Visualizes colors as swatches or gradients.
•	Creates plots to display color palettes using matplotlib.
Module 7: Input/Output Utilities
•	Parses and validates input colors.
•	Exports colors or palettes to JSON, CSV, or image formats.
Module 8: Testing and Validation
•	Validates the correctness of color operations using a test suite.
•	Ensures proper handling of invalid input and edge cases.

4. System Flow
1.	Input Phase:
o	Accept color(s) in any format (e.g., HEX, RGB).
o	Validate and parse the input.
2.	Processing Phase:
o	Perform requested color operations (e.g., conversion, blending).
o	Optionally analyze or manipulate colors.
3.	Output Phase:
o	Return colors in the desired format.
o	Optionally visualize or export the results.
6. Optional Features
•	Color Palette Generation: Automatically generate harmonious color palettes.
•	Image-Based Color Extraction: Extract dominant or average colors from images.
•	Web Color Compatibility: Include named web colors and compatibility checks (e.g., WCAG contrast ratio)
